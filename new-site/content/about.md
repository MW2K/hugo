## About this site

* This site was generated in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which is no relation to [[Hugo A Go-Go]](https://batfink.fandom.com/wiki/Hugo_A_Go-Go).

* **Petergreenwell.com** is a personal home page - that is, it contains various things ranging from fiction to reflections on existence.

* It is **deliberately** low-key and non Web 2.0 in appearance.

* This site does not set cookies :cookie:, nor does it track you in any way (apart from what the web server logs).

* Unless noted, everything on this site is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)

* I maintain three other domains. [Here](https://ulujain.org/), [here](https://aesedra.com/) and my shop which is at [this site](https://theblackcathouse.com/).

* The **Aesedra.com** domain is where I will keep the Aesedra wiki. Nothing there yet. I have a business to set up and operate first!

* If you cannot see flag emojis, i.e :belarus:, :st_kitts_nevis: and they render as country codes instead etc, you are most likely using Windows. The **Segoe UI Emoji** font that Windows uses for emojis lacks glyphs for flags. To fix this, install the font found [here](https://github.com/perguto/Country-Flag-Emojis-for-Windows).

## About me

* In age, I’m somewhere between Daniel Craig and Viggo Mortensen. I’m Australian, and I’m probably bits and pieces of everything European.

* I hold a Bachelor of Arts (Honours), and a Bachelor of Environmental Science.

* My Arts major was in Gothic and Dark Romantic literature.

* My Environmental Science major was in environmental resource management.

* What this means is that I could give you advice on the anti-Catholic origins of the Gothic while out doing fauna surveys in a rainforest.

* I don’t “do” social media in the main - I should, as I want to run a business but...

* I have a **Twitter/X** account, but use it rarely. [Here, if you like](https://x.com/petergreenwell).

## Still here?

* I write, which is the primary purpose of this site. What am I writing? Try [this](/imwriting.html).

* I listen to music that largely reflects my age bracket. 70s/80s post-punk, Gothic music in its various forms, paisley underground, metal, psych rock and prog rock. Dark, weird stuff. I’m one of these dinosaurs that despises most modern music.

* I read mostly science fiction and fantasy, though I’ll devour anything that’s well-written. **Elmore Leonard** is an excellent resource on how to do dialogue right.

* Although I’m straight, I support and encourage LGBTQIA+ lifestyles and rights. I'm not *woke* - it's called applying critical thinking.

* And on the critical thinking subject, although I hold a few conservative values, I’m probably best regarded as a bleeding heart liberal. As an Australian, “liberal” means a whole lot more than the narrow definitions that are prevalent in some parts of the world. As does “conservative” for that matter.

* While finding many of their policies and approaches needlessly confronting, I support the Australian Greens, and the Fusion Party, of whom I'm a member.

* I’m in love with Midjourney and other avenues of AI generated art. AI is the future - embrace it!

* Pictures generated by Midjourney are used on this site.

* **Walla Walla** is both a town in the US and what **Ale the Parrot** says in [Ultima 7: The Black Gate](https://wiki.ultimacodex.com/wiki/Ultima_VII:_The_Black_Gate). Oh, you read down this far? Marvellous!
