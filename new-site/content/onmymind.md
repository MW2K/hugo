# What's on my mind

:love_hotel: [Home](/index.html)

Mostly about my **Fels** stories, but some are on other subjects. I'm
perpetually indebted to [Midjouney](https://www.midjourney.com/app),
Bing's [Image Creator](https://www.bing.com/images/create/) and
DeviantArt's [DreamUp](https://www.deviantart.com/dreamup) for the
pictures, without which, these entries would be colourless expanses of
text.

-   :older_adult: [Personnel roster for Kempson Base](/kempson.html)
-   :older_man: [The endeavours of Eddings](/eddings.html)

On Fels - the images within were created in Midjourney which are public
domain to my understanding

-   :mage: [Odylicism, or the magic of Fels](/odylicism.html)
-   :trident: [The armies of Fels](/armies.html)
-   :vampire_woman: [The goddess Maorth](/maorth.html)

What passes for blog material and miscellanea. It's just stuff
that I can't classify elsewhere.
