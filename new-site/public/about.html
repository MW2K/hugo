<p>I maintain three other domains. <a href="https://ulujain.org/">Here</a>, <a href="https://aesedra.com/">here</a> and my shop which is at <a href="https://theblackcathouse.com/">this site</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Aesedra.com</strong> domain is where I will keep the Aesedra wiki. Nothing there yet. I have a business to set up and operate first!</p>

<p>If you cannot see flag emojis, i.e &#x1f1e7;&#x1f1fe;, &#x1f1f0;&#x1f1f3; and they render as country codes instead etc, you are most likely using Windows. The <strong>Segoe UI Emoji</strong> font that Windows uses for emojis lacks glyphs for flags. To fix this, install the font found <a href="https://github.com/perguto/Country-Flag-Emojis-for-Windows">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In age, I’m somewhere between Daniel Craig and Viggo Mortensen. I’m Australian, and I’m probably bits and pieces of everything European.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hold a Bachelor of Arts (Honours), and a Bachelor of Environmental Science.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My Arts major was in Gothic and Dark Romantic literature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My Environmental Science major was in environmental resource management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What this means is that I could give you advice on the anti-Catholic origins of the Gothic while out doing fauna surveys in a rainforest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t “do” social media in the main - I should, as I want to run a business but&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have a <strong>Twitter/X</strong> account, but use it rarely. <a href="https://x.com/petergreenwell">Here, if you like</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>I write, which is the primary purpose of this site. What am I writing? Try <a href="/imwriting.html">this</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I listen to music that largely reflects my age bracket. 70s/80s post-punk, Gothic music in its various forms, paisley underground, metal, psych rock and prog rock. Dark, weird stuff. I’m one of these dinosaurs that despises most modern music.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I read mostly science fiction and fantasy, though I’ll devour anything that’s well-written. <strong>Elmore Leonard</strong> is an excellent resource on how to do dialogue right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although I’m straight, I support and encourage LGBTQIA+ lifestyles and rights. I&rsquo;m not <em>woke</em> - it&rsquo;s called applying critical thinking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And on the critical thinking subject, although I hold a few conservative values, I’m probably best regarded as a bleeding heart liberal. As an Australian, “liberal” means a whole lot more than the narrow definitions that are prevalent in some parts of the world. As does “conservative” for that matter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While finding many of their policies and approaches needlessly confronting, I support the Australian Greens, and the Fusion Party, of whom I&rsquo;m a member.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m in love with Midjourney and other avenues of AI generated art. AI is the future - embrace it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pictures generated by Midjourney are used on this site.</p>

<p><strong>Walla Walla</strong> is both a town in the US and what <strong>Ale the Parrot</strong> says in <a href="https://wiki.ultimacodex.com/wiki/Ultima_VII:_The_Black_Gate">Ultima 7: The Black Gate</a>. Oh, you read down this far? Marvellous!</p>
